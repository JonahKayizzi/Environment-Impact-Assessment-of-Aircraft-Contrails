    "- Improving model output and derivation of results from the output\n",

    "Improving model input\n",
    "- Geographical scope. Google Research was limited to North America, and recommends further research for Africa & Europe. The presents a possible direction of focussion on Africa\n",
    "  - Involves identifying satellite datasets suitable for Africa\n",
    "  - Identify the limitations of the Geos satellite\n",
    "- Might also focus on areas in Africa that are susceptible to heavy cloud formation and hence contrail formation. Such areas could be costal regions, mountains, lakes and dense forests. \n",
    "  - Identify the prevalant conditions in those areas that contribute to contrail formation that cna be added to the model input or improve model input\n",
    "- Focus on Rwanda and use the provided Rwanda weather dataset\n",
